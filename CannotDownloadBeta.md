### I joined the beta community, but cannot download the application ###

It takes some time for Google to process the fact that you joined the beta community, and to grant you access to Ready in the Play Store. Few people reported that it took several hours, so please be patient, we cannot make this go faster.

1) Make sure that you joined the Ready Beta Community: https://plus.google.com/communities/112787218216567343899

2) Make sure that you opted in to be a tester here:
https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.ready.android â€”
**if the site is not working, please try again later, as it takes some time to activate**

3) After your beta request processed, you will be able to download Ready here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ready.android.
Sometimes opening the url in an incognito window in your browser can help.
